--------
- a developer an forget to check for null, to avoid this Optional[means it can have null]
- creation
	- Optional.of(): if null is sent will throw error
	- Optional.ofNullable(): can assign null
	- Optinal.empty(): if null can assign empty
- access
	- optionalObject.isPresent():- check if value is not null
		- optionalObject.get to get the value
	- optionalObject.ifPresent(consumer): value passed to consumer is value present in optional
	- optionalObject.orElse("defaultValue"): if value is null or empty, defaultValue will
	- optionalObject.orElseGet(supplier)
	- optionalObject.orElseThrow(supplier)
- can use intermideate operation like map with optionalObject before getting the value and latter can get the value
