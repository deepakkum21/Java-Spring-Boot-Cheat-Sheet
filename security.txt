CSRF [cross site request forgery]
	- browser sends the session id
	- use CSRF-token

XSS [cross site scripting]
	- malicious scripts
	- can be used to steal the cookie by appending the document.cookie
	- use angular dom sanitization for all user input

CORS

SQL injection

Spring Security
---------------
@EnableWebSecurity <spring-boot-starter-security>
1. depending on the authenticationType security filter will be invoked
2. then passed to AuthenticationManager I [authenticate() -> ProviderManager]
3. delegates to AuthenticationProvider
4. bean securityFilterChain
	- authenticationProvider


@Configuration
@EnableMethodSecurity(
    prePostEnabled = true,  // Enable @PreAuthorize and @PostAuthorize
    securedEnabled = true,  // Enable @Secured annotation
    jsr250Enabled = true    // Enable @RolesAllowed annotation
)
public class SecurityConfig {
    // Spring Security method-level security is enabled here
}

@PreAuthorize: Enables pre-invocation security checks based on SpEL expressions.
@PostAuthorize: Enables post-invocation security checks based on SpEL expressions.
@Secured: Restricts method access based on roles/authorities.
@RolesAllowed: Restricts method access based on roles (from JSR-250).
@EnableAspectJAutoProxy: (Optional) Enables AOP for method security annotations


## Why csrf.disabled() done
- as we use stateless app, no session and no cookies

Date & Time classes
-------------------
-	problem in old
	- date & calender
		- mutable
		- confusing
		- limited functionality without zone[no calc]

1. LocalDate: Represents a date without a time zone.
2. LocalTime: Represents a time without a date or time zone.
3. LocalDateTime: Represents a date and time without a time zone.
4. ZonedDateTime: Represents a date and time with a time zone.
5. Instant: Represents an instantaneous point on the timeline, typically used for machine timestamps.
6. Duration: Represents a duration of time between two points in time.
7. Period: Represents a period of time between two dates.
8.DateTimeFormatter: Formats and parses dates and times.


Method Reference [::]
- when lambda expression can be replaced with method of some class/object
	- the method should do same thing what lambda was suppose to do [same parameter/return]
- same but with constructor is constructor reference
	- ClassName::new
